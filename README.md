Table of Contents : 
    Exercise 1 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Note: for this exercise, the expectation is that you explicitly write out the year (and therefore be out of date the next year).

    Exercise 2 (and Solution)
The exercise comes first (with a few extras if you want the extra challenge or want to spend more time), followed by a discussion. Enjoy!
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

    Exercise 3 (and Solution)
Take a list, say for example this one:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

    Exercise 4 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    Exercise 5 (and Solution)
Take two lists, say for example these two:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

   Exercise 6 (and Solution)
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

   Exercise 7 (and Solution)
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

  Exercise 8 (and Solution)
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

  Exercise 9 (and Solution)
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

  Exercise 10 (and Solution)
This week’s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.
Take two lists, say for example these two:
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

   Exercise 11 (and Solution)
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your answer to Exercise 4 to help you. Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.

    Exercise 12 (and Solution)
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

  Exercise 13
Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonacci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …)

    Exercise 14 (and Solution)
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

    
    Exercise 15 (and Solution)
Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

    
    Exercise 16 (and Solution)
Note: this is a 4-chili exercise, not because it introduces a concept, but because this exercise is more like a project. Feel free to skip this and come back when you’re more ready!
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

    Exercise 17 (and Solution)
Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout the game and tell the user at the end.
